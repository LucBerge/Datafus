You just need to sit on your Seemyool facing backwards, and steer without seeing where you are going; alternatively, you can sit facing forwards to see where you're going but make your Seemyool move opposite to all your instructions \u2013 that is backwards when you're going forwards. You'll get used to it right quick, you'll see."}
