Just as fiery (though not quite as evil) as his name suggests, this sidekick lives to play with fire. Despite being aggressive, impulsive and liable to blow his top at any moment, he still keeps his distance so he can strike enemies like a bolt from the blue. Beelzebug will make your enemies break into a sweat, and with good reason... He's on fire!", "characteristics": ["Primary characteristics : AP:                                 11", "Primary characteristics : MP:                                 6", "Primary characteristics : Range:                                 6", "Primary characteristics : Power:                                 1200", "Secondary characteristics : AP Parry:                                 60", "Secondary characteristics : MP Parry:                                 60", "Secondary characteristics : Dodge:                                 60", "Secondary characteristics : Lock:                                 30", "Secondary characteristics : MP Reduction:                                 80", "Secondary characteristics : Prospecting:                                 100", "Damage : Damage:                                 80", "Resistances (%) : Earth (%):                                 20", "Resistances (%) : Fire (%):                                 10", "Resistances (%) : Water (%):                                 10", "Resistances (%) : Air (%):                                 10", "Resistances (%) : Neutral (%):                                 10"]}
