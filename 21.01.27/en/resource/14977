Queues of citizens lined up at the port every winter to give it a stroke. Even after the ball was carried away by the storm that ripped off a chunk of Frigost Island, replicas have been made and fondled ever since - at least, that's what the P.A.N.T.S. prophets who gave you this imitation told you."}
