If you have the misfortune to walk on an old Ambusher hidden in the long grass, you may remain caught until it devours your boots entirely. On the other hand, if you manage to make off with an intact Ambusher bud, you will be able to hush the most moany of Fecas by offering it to them and pretending it is chewing gum."}
