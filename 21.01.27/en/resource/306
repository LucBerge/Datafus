Indeed, who has never blown an Evil Dandelion Flower down the neck of a coveted lover? Such beautiful seeds, sweet as the touch of a shaft of sunlight on the dew-damp leaves of a charm tree. Perhaps Iops, who, instead of blowing, tend to suck the seeds and choke miserably in terrible convulsions."}
