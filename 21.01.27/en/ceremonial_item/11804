They say no one in this lifetime has ever seen one. Yet, on very cold mornings when mist still clings to the soles of your boots, you can sometimes find a blue feather amongst all the yellow in the squares in front of Tofu houses. The presence of this feather is considered a blessing, for the visit of the mysterious Blue Tofu is always a sign of joy, everlasting and bountiful.  (Place this amulet over another, already-equipped amulet to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0"]}
