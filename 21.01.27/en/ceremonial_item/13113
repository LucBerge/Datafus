This jazzed-up diving headgear will allow a Scampihorse to disappear down into the deepest, darkest depths of Sufokia for days on end for a little \"alone time\". As for you, you can use it as a scuba-diving mask, but please try to stay afloat. We wouldn't want to have to call the rescue team out again.  (Place this headgear over other, already-equipped headgear to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Title: Defender of the Depths", "Compatible with: 0"]}
