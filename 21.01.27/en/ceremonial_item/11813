The idea of using the Platypus as a mascot for the event came after the pet, known as being indomitable, was introduced to the masses. The trainer who can subdue the animal has definitely earned his stripes. So far, no one has succeeded, the animal preferring to choose its own master and do exactly whatever it wants. Holders of the cap believe themselves to be rebel elements of a theocratic society known for its rigidity.
