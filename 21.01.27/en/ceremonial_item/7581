That means you can't put anything in it. And it's very heavy. A bit like a Iop who's been lost in the Astrub Tavern for several months. What's over, contrary to appearances, the Pineapi Bag is not part of the Pineapi Set. In short, it's a completely useless item, thus a vital one. (Place this cape over another, already-equipped cape to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0", "Compatible with: 0"]}
