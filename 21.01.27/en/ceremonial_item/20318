It can change size at will, making this an item coveted by all, especially men who think that their virility depends on the size of their stick. It's often forgotten that too big a stick is impossible to handle, so why would you want a big stick at whatever cost if you're not going to use it?  (Place this cloak over another, already-equipped cloak to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0", "Compatible with: 0"]}
