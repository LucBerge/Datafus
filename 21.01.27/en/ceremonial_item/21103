This does not mean the moon as it is seen, but rather the \"Fleastal\" moon, calculated using an inexact but traditional method. The \"civilised\" peoples of the World of Twelve\u00a0\u2013 having adopted both the Grougorian calendar reform and a concurrent correction for the lunar cycle\u00a0\u2013 often celebrate on a different day than the \"primitive\" peoples, and the discrepancy can be either nothing, or one or five weeks (depending on the year), or exceptionally four weeks if there is a new moon in Bonta but not in Brakmar.  (Place this cape over another, already-equipped cape to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0", "Compatible with: 0"]}
