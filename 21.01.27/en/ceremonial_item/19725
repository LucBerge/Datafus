When they're fighting fit, the shield is solid and radiant. On the other hand, if ever you should suffer from nasty stomachache or gangrene, for example, avoid holding it, because nobody wants to see that.  (Place this shield over another, already-equipped shield to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0"]}
