Indeed, it has been imbued with the character of its former wearer, an impish little monkey whose main occupation was annoying the gods by playing bad tricks on them all day long. The monkey ended up being turned into a mountain, so go easy on the jokes.  (Place this headgear over other, already-equipped headgear to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0"]}
