It is actually a kind of glider disguised as a shield, which the Az'Hassins raise above themselves before jumping from a high spot to enter or escape somewhere by air. Since its canvas is very fragile, a mere encounter with a small bird in flight could pierce it and make you fall. Also, even experienced Az'Hassins hardly use it, reluctant to end their lives in such an inglorious way.  (Place this shield over another, already-equipped shield to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0"]}
