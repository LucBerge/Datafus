During the time it took to perfect his skill with this rare instrument, he managed to send all the other farmers running for the hills, meaning he now owns all the wheat fields in Amakna and his fortune is guaranteed. (Place this scythe over another, already-equipped scythe to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0"], "characteristics": ["AP:                                 4 (1 use per turn)", "Range:                                 1", "CH:                                 1/22 (+7)"]}
