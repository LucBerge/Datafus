You can, of course, get attacked in a crypt, but not by the crypt itself, or so your friends tell you. It's clear that those oblivious fools have never been attacked by a garden shed, or they'd have bought this shield too.  (Place this shield over another, already-equipped shield to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0"]}
