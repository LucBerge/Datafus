Unlike Sangroku's staff, it can't be placed on the floor, it can only get shorter, which is not much use and is a source of inferiority complexes.  This weapon is still charged with Kawotz the Gwandpa Wabbit's magic. You may be able to use it to summon him.", "characteristics": ["AP:                                 5 (1 use per turn)", "Range:                                 1", "CH:                                 1/5 (+10)"], "effects": ["12 to 16 (Water damage)", "Level #5 Incarnation"]}
