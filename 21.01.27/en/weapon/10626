Although I'm not sure you've ever thought about it. Iop knows I've never thought of it myself, the life of a good, long, tall, strong Chafer Foot Soldier like Koksiks. In fact, I often lie awake at night, not thinking of the life of a Chafer Foot Soldier. Wonderful lads.\r Anyway, enough of that. This sword is still infused with the spirit of Koksiks, and by equipping it, you could become him.", "characteristics": ["AP:                                 5 (1 use per turn)", "Range:                                 1", "CH:                                 1/5 (+5)"], "effects": ["15 to 22 (Earth damage)", "Level #5 Incarnation"]}
