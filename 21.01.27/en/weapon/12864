After a hard day's work at Gutenblimp's press, he fashioned his sword from a Kwismas tree branch and went along the Taiga to slay the dragons who, according to him, were hiding inside the gifts. This weapon is still imbued with the Goblimp Rint's magic. Maybe when you use it, a little slice of his heroic spirit will flare up in you!", "characteristics": ["AP:                                 5 (1 use per turn)", "Range:                                 1", "CH:                                 1/5 (+10)"], "effects": ["22 to 25 (Neutral damage)", "Level #5 Incarnation"]}
