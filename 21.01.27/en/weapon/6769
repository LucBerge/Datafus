Farle used it to make huge haystacks - higher than the biggest Elm growing in the Eltneg forest of old. It is said that Brouce Boulgoure himself felled the tree for this staff, in return for an unbelievable quantity of oat flakes, which Shika Ingalsse herself offered. He used to gulp down fistfuls before spending days on end hacking entire phyla out of existence.", "characteristics": ["AP:                                 5 (1 use per turn)", "Range:                                 1", "CH:                                 1/30 (+6)"], "effects": ["15 to 26 (Neutral damage)", "2 to 3 (Neutral steal)", "151 to 200 Initiative", "51 to 70 Vitality", "61 to 80 Strength", "11 to 15 Power", "2 to 3 Damage", "2 to 3% Critical"], "conditions": "Strength > 90 and Vitality > 90", "craft": [{"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/749-bakelelite", "quantity": 4}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/2271-purple-megabwork-leather", "quantity": 1}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/2273-purple-fabric", "quantity": 10}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/2647-mabwork-ear", "quantity": 7}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/14468-wa-wobot-beard", "quantity": 1}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/14635-nugget", "quantity": 60}], "set": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/sets/17-farle-ingalsse-set"}
