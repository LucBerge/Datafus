If you were to ask him, however, he'd demonstrate that it's much easier to stick daggers into someone's stomach than an unwieldy axe. These weapons are still charged with Hichete the Barbrossa's magic. You may be able to use them to summon him.", "characteristics": ["AP:                                 3 (2 uses per turn)", "Range:                                 1", "CH:                                 1/25 (+10)"], "effects": ["9 to 14 (Air damage)", "Level #5 Incarnation"]}
