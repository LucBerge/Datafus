From a young age, this Sadida dedicated his humble life to Gobbly hunting... the villagers found it hilarious... word spread and soon folk came from all around to watch him hunt those ridiculous balls of wool. His revenge was terrible and long-lived. When the price of Gobbly skins skyrocketed, he became so rich that he paid to have every last villager who mocked him hunted down and murdered. He's storing their skins too, but the stock market isn't going his way.", "characteristics": ["AP:                                 3 (2 uses per turn)", "Range:                                 1", "CH:                                 1/30 (+3)"], "effects": ["12 to 15 (Neutral damage)", "3 to 4 (Neutral steal)", "31 to 50 Agility", "71 to 100 Vitality", "26 to 40 Wisdom", "2 to 3% Critical", "6 to 10 Prospecting"], "conditions": "Strength > 300 and Agility > 90", "craft": [{"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/747-aluminite", "quantity": 3}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/750-kouartz", "quantity": 6}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/7016-dark-bamboo-wood", "quantity": 12}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/7027-topaz", "quantity": 2}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/7035-pyrute", "quantity": 3}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/7036-brassic", "quantity": 4}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/16001-vilinsekt-antennae", "quantity": 2}]}
