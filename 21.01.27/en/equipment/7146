It has one prior owner who had the strange and despicable habit of dressing up as other people, and conning the elderly into signing over items of tiny value.

It is said he ran off with three party poppers and a half-eaten ball of Stracciatella ice cream, laughing wildly... still laughing as he tripped and fell over the cliff and laughing to this day if you believe the popular but unlikely sea shanty, 'The crazy fool took my Stracciatella'.", "effects": ["81 to 120 Vitality", "31 to 40 Intelligence", "31 to 40 Agility", "3 to 4% Earth Resistance", "3 to 4% Water Resistance", "7 to 10 Heals"], "craft": [{"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/749-bakelelite", "quantity": 4}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/844-slate-dreggon-egg", "quantity": 10}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/8077-brown-warko-boomerang", "quantity": 1}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/15263-rose-sands", "quantity": 60}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/16150-venerable-treechnid-root", "quantity": 13}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/18385-mantiscore-heart", "quantity": 1}]}
