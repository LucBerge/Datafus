Although he was refused for being too weak, he was contacted by an alchemist in Amakna who was determined to use him as a guinea pig to test one of his new magic potions. The effect was immediate, and the young adventurer quickly turned into a real warrior, becoming incredibly strong\u2026 and incredibly stupid. In short, he became a Iop.
