Some would opt for the easy and economic solution: which is to not describe the item. But we're better than that. If a wall of text must be written, so be it! Here we go.  There's a lot that you can say about the nature of indescribability. It could have several meanings: it might mean that we don't have the right words to describe the thing in question, because it's completely unprecedented, because it's unlike anything we've ever known, or maybe also because we don't have the lexical knowledge necessary to choose the right words that will best express the indescribable nature of the thing. It's easy to hide behind such a phrase: \"Haha! It's indescribable!\", pronounced in a very persuasive tone. But is that really the case?  If we search deep inside, maybe an exact and appropriate description will reveal itself. Something sufficiently clear, and at the time sufficiently abstract to facilitate understanding of the described thing. If the words aren't sufficient, maybe it's necessary to invent new ones? Words coming from the heart. Words which speak for themselves when the limits of language have been reached. The indescribable, in the end, is actually an unknown, which requires only that we put forth the effort to understand it, to let your imagination, your reason, and your feelings play in order to better understand and therefore find the words that could describe it.But that would be too much work for a simple cape description.", "effects": ["401 to 500 Vitality", "71 to 90 Agility", "41 to 60 Wisdom", "16 to 20 Air Damage", "7 to 10% Fire Resistance", "11 to 15 Critical Damage", "2 Range"], "craft": [{"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/15715-vortex-wing", "quantity": 3}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/17864-ambergris", "quantity": 3}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/17976-meno-hair", "quantity": 11}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/17984-yalgy-tentacle", "quantity": 76}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/17985-skt-zo-leg", "quantity": 95}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/17988-angular-stone", "quantity": 8}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/17989-koutoulou-larva-wing", "quantity": 9}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/17991-mahaquany-wood", "quantity": 50}]}
