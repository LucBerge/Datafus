Gobsmacked, he quickly shoved it into his bag without trying to identify the source of this bounty. Overjoyed to have had what he could have earned after a hard year's labour just drop into his lap, he headed to the village determined to put the money to good use at the inn. After spreading his good news liberally around the village, he went home to bed, his spirits high and slightly befuddled. The next morning, all that was left of the farmer was his hat next to a small pile of gold."}
