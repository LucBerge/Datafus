Well, it depends how you define tough, I guess. If you're talking about a vampire that snickers before flying off\u00a0\u2013 you know the sound, it's a bit like \"gnak gnook gnak gnak\"\u00a0\u2013 then \"tough\" is probably the wrong adjective. Such laughter could put to rout an army. An army of ticks, that is."}
