They may eventually beach on the black sand beaches of Alma's Cradle after floating around for several years. Once they're back on terra firma, they're generally thirsty for revenge. But since they can't take revenge on the sea, they take revenge on the weak, as well as tourists, or just simply weak tourists."}
