He pulls it out from underneath his wizard robe, which he wears when attending role-play evenings. That doesn't stop you from sticking it in his spokes, or anywhere else for that matter. This weapon is still charged with Haku the Zoth Master's magic. You may be able to use it to summon him.", "characteristics": ["AP:                                 3 (2 uses per turn)", "Range:                                 1", "CH:                                 1/15 (+7)"], "effects": ["9 to 14 (Fire damage)", "Level #5 Incarnation"]}
