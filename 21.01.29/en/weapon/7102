Only the horrible, pitiless Liche refused to recognise his immense talent. Offended that such a creature wouldn't stand in awe before his creations, he issued an ultimatum, refusing to forge so much as a teaspoon until his sword smith skills received the public recognition they deserved. But he hadn't reckoned on the horrible Liche, who never gave in. A century or so later, the smith had to resign himself to going back to work\u2026 even though his skills had gotten rusty. This ridiculous sword was his last usable creation. The years passed by and the sword's true power was finally discovered. If shattered, the sword released an evil energy which would do lasting damage to Liche's economic activities. Mocked, provoked, humiliated, and beaten at her own game, she feigned giving up, only to come back meaner than ever and take her revenge when the time was right.", "characteristics": ["AP:                                 2 (2 uses per turn)", "Range:                                 1", "CH:                                 1/30 (+5)"], "effects": ["11 to 15 (HP restored)", "16 to 20 Vitality", "11 to 15 Intelligence", "2 Lock", "5 Heals"], "craft": [{"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/307-moskito-wings", "quantity": 3}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/16489-particle-board", "quantity": 1}]}
