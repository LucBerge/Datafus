Seeing him fighting with his fists, sword in hand, was one of most grotesque spectacles. This weapon is still charged with Rapiat the Rat Suenami's magic. You may be able to use it to summon him.", "characteristics": ["AP:                                 4 (1 use per turn)", "Range:                                 1", "CH:                                 1/5 (+10)"], "effects": ["14 to 18 (Earth damage)", "Level #5 Incarnation"]}
