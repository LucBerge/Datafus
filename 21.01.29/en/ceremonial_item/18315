Posing as quite normal individuals to more easily spread chaos, there's been a marked increase in the number of them in the civilized world. In order to combat this scourge, some adventurers with sharpened senses have decided to take up arms and wear this shield as a distinguishing sign. Be careful though, because there might be some Trools who are smarter than the others hiding in their ranks.  (Place this shield over another, already-equipped shield to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Title: Trool Hunter", "Compatible with: 0"]}
