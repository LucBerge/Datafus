Dark and crumbly, it cannot be used for construction, or as an ornament, and has very little commercial value. It would seem that its low resistance could make it an inexpensive form of protection. However, the most notable effect of this rock is to plunge the person who carries it into a deep depression.  (Place this shield over another, already-equipped shield to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0"]}
