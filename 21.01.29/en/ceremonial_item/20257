Indeed, it represents the equivalent of tens of dirty tissues rolled into one, so your enemies had better use sanitising gel or any other disinfectant after hitting your shield, or they'll catch a cold that would make the most energetic of Trools lethargic.   (Place this shield over another, already-equipped shield to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0"]}
