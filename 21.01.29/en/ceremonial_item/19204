He's given them a whistle so they can easily call him in case of difficulty. But clearly not everyone has the same understanding of the word \"difficulty\", so the knight has a very busy schedule that alternates between epic fights and thankless chores. (Place this shield over another, already equipped shield to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0"]}
