A master in the art of grimacing, he will give your opponent a compendium of extremely annoying facial expressions. Unfortunately for your opponents, no one can try and beat him at this little game, because you can't teach an old shield new faces.  (Place this shield over another, already-equipped shield to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0"]}
