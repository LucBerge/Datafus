It turns out he's attached himself to you, and he's changing colour to suit your outfit. So be careful, because if you're one of those people who dresses any old how, you'll both be matching, but doubly ridiculous.  (Place this pet over another, already-equipped pet to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0"]}
