This tiara brings a certain breath of fresh air to Iops' image. However, that won't stop some of them from using it as a weapon in a fistfight if the situation warrants it. As the saying goes, a leopard cannot change its spots!  (Place this headgear over other, already-equipped headgear to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0"]}
