Is it a thimble? A game die? A small chest? Nobody ever knew the answer. It was thought, probably wrongly, that it could be an imitation of an ancient, long-forgotten artefact whose shape could have survived the fashions, irrespective of its use. One reason for its success remains the welfare and assurance it provides its wearer, as if protected beyond time and space.  (Place this ring over another, already-equipped ring to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Title: Dimensional Walker", "Compatible with: 0"]}
