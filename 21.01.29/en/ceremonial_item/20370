Many theories abound. Some think it's an obese Tofu that grew in a skull; others prefer the version that says it's a skull animated by dark magic that caused it to grow wings and feet; while others still believe that a scientific experiment went horribly awry. One thing is sure: Karne is not the most affectionate animal ever, nor the cutest, but having it in your company will naturally give you a considerably evil aura.
