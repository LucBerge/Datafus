Anyone who wears it on their shoulders will make a real spectacle of themselves and Maria always played sell-out shows. Don't hope for too much when you put it on though, the public's not stupid enough to fall for it twice. (Place this cape over another, already-equipped cape to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0", "Compatible with: 0"]}
