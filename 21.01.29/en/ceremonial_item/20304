Indeed, if you are attacked head-on and you manage to counter the attack with these daggers, your body will\u00a0\u2013 on its own\u00a0\u2013 move to counterattack and kill your opponent for sure. If your enemies had the intelligence to attack all of you at the same time, you wouldn't have a chance, but since they stubbornly line up and attack one at a time, you'll massacre them.  (Place this weapon over another, already-equipped weapon to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0"]}
