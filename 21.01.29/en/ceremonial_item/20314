One day, he came up with the idea of making a beautiful diadem that he would offer to the most beautiful person he would meet in his life. But his quest never came to an end, for there was always some more beautiful person to discover, and he ended up losing his mind in search of ultimate beauty. Waurice must be turning in his grave knowing that his diadem is on your head. You may not be the most beautiful person in the world, but at least you're not crazy or dead.  (Place this headgear over other, already-equipped headgear to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0"]}
