In order to charm the one you love, you'll therefore have to shake your head vigorously to release these pheromones. Despite their effectiveness, it's quite likely you'll just look like an idiot. Using this helmet is not necessarily the best way to seduce people.  (Place this headgear over other, already-equipped headgear to change its appearance.)", "effects": ["Compatible with: 0"]}
