He didn't prove too much of a problem to his enemies due to his tactical errors. Essentially, his troops moved side to side as one big group, only advancing very slowly, instead of just moving forward in a straight line. This made them the easiest targets that Allister's Army had ever fought against.", "effects": ["2 to 3 Heals", "6 to 10 Intelligence"], "craft": [{"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/312-iron", "quantity": 1}, {"url": "https://www.dofus.com/en/mmorpg/encyclopedia/resources/16511-celestial-wool", "quantity": 4}]}
