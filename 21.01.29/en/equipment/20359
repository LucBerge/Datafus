They mock our costumes and our ancestral traditions. They take us for smelly barbarians, greedy and uncouth. They think us happy to stay in our mines, digging in the dark like Rotceres. But they are wrong! I will show them the Stubbyobs' true nature. I will burn their farms and crops. I will flatten their cities. I will shave their heads and eyebrows. I will shear their Gobballs. I will take their gold, empty their barrels, shred their banners. I am the King Under the Mountain\u2026 and soon, I shall be king of the world!  \u2013 Bram Worldbeard", "effects": ["When the bearer suffers an AP, MP or Range removal, they gain 3% weapon damage for 2 turns, stackable 5 times.", "351 to 400 Vitality", "61 to 80 Strength", "-30 MP Parry", "7 to 10% Weapon Damage", "-10% Spell Damage", "61 to 80 Intelligence", "7 to 10 Air Damage", "7 to 10 Water Damage", "7 to 10 Fire Damage", "7 to 10 Earth Damage", "7 to 10 Neutral Damage"]}
