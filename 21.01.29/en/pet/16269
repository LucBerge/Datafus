Before adolescence they're as docile as a lazy Bow Meow, but it's impossible to tell the males from the females, since their distinguishing features, at this age, haven't grown much bigger than their tails. The poachers working in Pandala make a nice bit of money from the trafficking of these creatures, to which you are contributing by taking this little Tanuk under your wing.", "conditions": "Subscribers only", "evolutionary_effects": ["0 MP Parry", "0 AP"]}
